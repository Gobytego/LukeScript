This script collection automatize **Openbox** installation and essentials tools and apply configurations, styles and themes. Althoughs is a collection of my particular configs may be interesting for someone.

  * `install -a all`: exec all scripts asking for each one if install or not.
  * `install -a all -d`: exec all scripts and answer default option.
  * `install -a 5,8-12`: install selected scripts.
  * `install -a bash`: install all actions with text bash in description.
